## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: CloudKit schema permanence drives Phase 1 priority -- data model must be designed carefully before any deployment
- [Roadmap]: Equipment CRUD chosen as Phase 1 vertical slice (simplest domain entity, proves full KMP-Swift-CloudKit stack)
- [Roadmap]: Sync infrastructure (SYNC-01, SYNC-02) in Phase 1; sync UX (SYNC-03..05) deferred to Phase 6

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: SKIE 0.10.9 lists compatibility up to Kotlin 2.3.0; Kotlin 2.3.10 may require SKIE 0.11.x -- verify during Phase 1 setup
- [Research]: Foundation Models requires iOS 26+ with A17 Pro/M1+ -- Phase 7 features must degrade gracefully
